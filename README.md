# Simple_Code_Safari
***
Rebuilding the dependency schema in a python project written by others could be a tedious operation, I wrote a simple algorithm that creates a graphical structure of nodes and branches to display an image of the dependencies. It has come in handy for me on multiple occasions.

## Dependencies
1. ast
2. pydot

## Application launch
Copy Simple_Code_Safari_Python.py into the project folder you want to analyze, an image called code_map.png will be created.

## Example
